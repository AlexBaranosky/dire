# dire

Decomplect error logic. Erlang-style supervisor error handling for Clojure. Inspired by the work of [Joe Armstrong](http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf).

## Installation

Available on Clojars:

    [dire "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

## Usage

```clojure
(ns mytask
  (:require [dire.core :refer [deftask defhandler supervise]]))

;;; Define a task to run. It's just a function.
(deftask divider [a b]
  (/ a b))

;;; For a task, specify an exception that can be raised and a function to deal with it.
(defhandler divider
  java.lang.ArithmeticException
  (partial println "Cannot divide by 0."))

(defhandler divider
  java.lang.NullPointerException
  (partial println "Ah! A Null Pointer Exception! Do something here!"))

;;; Invoke with the task name and it's arguments.
(supervise divider 10 0)
```

If an exception is raised that has no handler, it will be printed to `*out*`.
